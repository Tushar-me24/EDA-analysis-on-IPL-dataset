🏏 Exploratory Data Analysis on IPL (Indian Premier League)
📌 Objective
This project conducts a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset to uncover actionable insights about teams, players, match trends, and performance metrics. The analysis highlights winning patterns, identifies key players, and examines batting/fielding strategies.

📊 Dataset Overview
Source: IPL match data (matches.csv, deliveries.csv, or a combined dataset)

Data Points: Match outcomes, teams, toss decisions, venues, player performances, and more.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

🔍 Key EDA Steps
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Analysis of toss decision impact

Examining winning trends by team

Venue-based performance analysis

Match outcomes based on batting or fielding first

Individual player performance overview

Visualizations: key metrics, distributions, trends

📈 Key Insights
Teams that bat first have higher winning chances at certain venues.

Toss decision preferences change noticeably across different IPL seasons.

A small cohort of players consistently excels in both run-scoring and wicket-taking.

Some venues are best suited for batting-heavy approaches, while others give an edge to bowlers.

💡 What I Learned
Using pandas & seaborn for data wrangling and visualization

Effective implementation of pie charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps
